Panel A (top-left) – ~12.5k cal BP (Group 1, Late Glacial): cooler and more open temperate steppe/grassland, abundant grasses (Poaceae), patches of wormwood (Artemisia) and open-ground herbs, sparse woodland with scattered trees, some pioneer conifers/deciduous trees; lakeshore with sedges (Cyperaceae), slightly windy atmosphere, occasional bare soil. Panel B (top-right) – ~10–9k cal BP (Group 2, Early Holocene): milder climate, more continuous temperate deciduous oak woodland (Quercus) with understory, fewer open clearings; wetland fringe with alder (Alnus) and sedges (Cyperaceae). Panel C (bottom-left) – ~8.6k cal BP (Group 2–3): clear shift to Mediterranean elements: slopes with holm oak (Quercus ilex-type) and maquis shrubland including Phillyrea, some wild olive (Olea), mixed with remaining deciduous oaks in cooler spots; woodland–shrubland mosaic. Panel D (bottom-right) – ~3.6k cal BP (Group 3, Mid–Late Holocene): patchwork mosaic of deciduous oaks + holm oak, larger grassy openings, wetland edge with alder (Alnus) and sedges, occasional chestnut (Castanea), overall more open but natural.
