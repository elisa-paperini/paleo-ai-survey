# **Evaluation of AI-generated Paleo-ecological Reconstructions**

### **Project Overview**
This repository hosts the source code, assets, and datasets for a web-based survey designed to evaluate the scientific reliability of Generative AI images in paleo-ecology.
This study is part of a PhD research project at the intersection of AI and Archaeology, aimed at exploring the evolution of the relationship between human communities and non-human environments based on European pollen data.

### **Research Methodology**
The research workflow integrates predictive modelling and generative AI to translate quantitative data into visual narratives.
  - **Data Acquisition**: Pollen records were retrieved from the Neotoma Paleoecology Database.
  - **Predictive Phase**: Supervised machine learning algorithms were employed to predict the biome associated with specific pollen records.
  - **Generative Phase**: Landscape images were generated based on the pollen data and the predicted biomes to visualize the paleo-environments.
  - **Expert Evaluation**: A comparative survey (hosted in this repo) allows experts to assess the botanical and ecological accuracy of the AI outputs against the original biological data.

### **Case Studies**
The repository contains material for two distinct ecological contexts:
  - **Case Study 1 (Mediterranean):** Lake Martignano (Rome, Italy). Spanning the Late Glacial to Late Holocene transition.
  - **Case Study 2 (Nordic):** Årsjö (Southern Sweden). Analyzing the shift from post-glacial pioneer vegetation to early agricultural landscapes.
